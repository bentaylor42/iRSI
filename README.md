This is an iPhone app to assist medical staff in performing emergency anaesthesia safely.

More information on the app as a whole at http://www.rsiready.com

The code here is for version 2.0, which is a complete, from the top down, rewrite of the original app which is currently out for iPhone on the App Store

I'm making an equivalent App for Android (RSI Ready), which I'll load on here too when I get the chance
